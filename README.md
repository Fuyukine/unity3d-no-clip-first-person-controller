Unity3d First Person Controller
===============================

Synopsis
--------

It's a pretty straightforward little NoClipFirstPersonController.  Useful for
movement within map editors and debug modes.

Installation
------------

Copy the NoClipFirstPersonController directory to your Assets/Plugins folder.  
Make the plugins folder if it doesn't exist.
